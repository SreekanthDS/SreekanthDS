# Hey, I'm Sreekanth! 🚀

## Who am I? 👇🏻
I'm not your run-of-the-mill coder; I'm a Computer Science Maestro 🧑🏻‍🎓, a Software Sorcerer 🧑🏻‍💻, and a Gaming Guru 🕹️! Currently soaking up all the tech wisdom the cosmos has to offer. Oh, and I graduated with First-Class Honours? Well, duh! 😛

## What's my game plan? 🎮
In 2023, I'm leveling up from yesterday's me. Fun fact: I wield the troubleshooting gun for hardware headaches 🔫 and dance with assembly 🖥️. Not-so-fun fact: Math isn't my fan, but I conquer it like a freakin' pro 😐. Anime ❤️📺🍿 is my off-duty escape, and my motto? "Everything you can imagine is real" 🙃!

## Where do I code magic? 💻
Currently, I'm the Full-Stack Maestro @ International Workplace. Imagine a symphony of code, and that's my workspace.

## Formal brag time 🤵🏻🤫
Hold on to your code hats! I'm a high-flying Computer Science grad, flaunting a first-class honours degree. With over three years in the software realm, I've not just coded; I've orchestrated solutions with finesse. My journey in the vibrant startup world and close-knit teams has been a masterclass in learning and achievement, surpassing the conventional software gig. Juggling multiple projects, doing code reviews, and crafting container-based applications for breakfast is where I excel. Meticulous, fastidious, and friendlier than your average code compiler. Ready to apply my logical prowess, coding wizardry, and collaborative finesse wherever innovation calls.
